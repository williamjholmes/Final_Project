I will be doing an individual project.
I plan to create data visualizations using Chart.js after researching.  I thought it would also be interesting to use public data, which seems to be most commonly done with Chart.js by using Cube API.  I haven't decided exactly what this data will be however. 

Chart.js: https://awesome.cube.dev/tools/chartjs
Cube API: https://cube.dev/?ref=eco-chartjs

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cviaxmiwnptr/pga-tour-results-2001-to-may-2024/data
